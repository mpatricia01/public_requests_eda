# Executive Summary

Colleges and universities identify prospective students by purchasing “student lists” from College Board, ACT, and other vendors. Student lists contain the contact information of prospective students that meet the criteria (e.g., test score range, high school GPA, zip codes) specified when buying the list. Sometimes referred to as “names,” student lists are a fundamental input for undergraduate recruiting campaigns, which target individual prospects by mail, email, and on social media.

After two years of data collection and analysis of the student list business, our central thesis is that student list products are structurally racist and classist. Structural racism is "a form of systematic racial bias embedded in the 'normal' functions of laws and social relations" [@RN4760, p. 1143]. In a structurally racist system, processes viewed as normal or neutral systematically advantage dominant groups and disadvantage dominated groups. @RN4421 argues that formal and informal organizational processes are important mechanisms of structural racism. We observe structural racism in the recruiting behavior of colleges and universities. On one hand, we observe reverse-redlining by "predatory" for-profit colleges [CITTOM]. On the other hand, we observe selective universities targeting affluent, predominantly white schools and communities in off-campus recruiting visits [@RN4759; @RN4733]. Thus, we initiated research about student lists with a focus on investigating the presence of structural racism in list-buying practices of universities. Over time, we learned that the student list products themselves are structurally racist.

Recent research suggests that student lists have surprisingly large effects on college access outcomes for millions of students each year. @RN4739 compared SAT test-takers who opted into the College Board Student Search Service – allowing accredited institutions to “licence” their contact information – to test-takers who opted out. For students with the same SAT score, parental education, race/ethnicity, sex, and high school, 41.1% of students who participated in Search attended a 4-year college compared to 32.8% of students who opted out, an 8.3 (=41.1-32.8) percentage point difference and a 25.3 (=(41.1-32.8)/32.8) percent change. Furthermore, this percent change was higher for students from populations that have historically been excluded from higher education.

“The theory of racialized organizations argues that structural racism is often enacted through formal and informal organizational processes that privilege certain racial groups at the expense of others”

Structural racism is present when what is viewed as normal or neutral systematically disadvantages groups that are already disadvantaged
