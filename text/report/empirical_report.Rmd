# Introduction

On March 8th 2020, a selective public research university ordered several "student lists" from College Board. Student lists contain the contact information of prospective students. Several orders targeted women in STEM fields, including an order given the title "NR 2021 Female AP STEM," which targeted nonresident high school students from 26 states, who identified as female, were in the high school class of 2021, had a high school GPA of B to A+, and received a 4 or higher on an AP exam in a STEM subject (e.g., calculus, biology, chemisty, computer science, statistics). Another order titled "NR 2021 Female SAT STEM" targeted the same prospects except the AP exam search filter was replaced with scoring between a 1300 and 1600 on the SAT [MAYBE CUT THIS SENTENCE].

The university purchases lists of prospective female STEM students in order to overcome the under-representation of women in STEM degree programs, which has been a nationwide policy concern for decades [CITE]. However, an analysis of the purchased prospects suggests that efforts to overcome one problem are creating other problems. Figure X shows recruiting female STEM prospects based on AP scores yields a set of prospects from almost exclusively affluent communities and they are recruiting prospects who identify as white or Asian but not prospects who identify as Black or Latinx. [ONE OR TWO SENTENCES GIVING RESULTS]. These results are consistent with socioeconomic and racial disparities in access to AP coursework.


Although prior research suggests that student lists have a surprisingly large effect on college access [@RN4739; @RN4752; @RN4740], the women in STEM vignette highlights concern of who is being included. We argue that student list products exclude students in two ways. First, universities cannot purchase the contact information of prospects who are not included in the underlying database. In general, College Board and ACT student list products only include test-takers, but test-taking rates differ substantially across race and class [@RN0006].^[FOOTNOTE; ACT NRCCUA] Second, the "search filters" on student list products enable universities to choose the prospects included in a purchase. While universities choose filters based on their preferences, these choices are structured by what the product allows. Several search filters (e.g., zip-code, AP exam score, "geodemographic" segment) may systematically exclude protected classes and other populations that are underrepresented in higher education (e.g., rural students). 


Prior research has not examined which filter criteria universities select when purchasing student lists, what are the characteristics of purchased prospects, or the relationship between filter criteria and student characteristics. We collected data about student list purchases by issuing public records requests to public universities in five states. This report focuses on student lists purchased from College Board and addresses three research questions: 

1. Which filter criteria were selected in student lists purchased by universities in our sample?
1. What are the characteristics of prospects included in student lists purchased by universities in our sample?
1. What is the relationship between student list filter criteria and the characteristics of purchased prospects?

<!--  CUT TEXT
Due to data collection challenges, our analysis sample cannot be considered a random sample. Nevertheless, this research is an important first step towards developing a body of empirical research that informs policy discourse about regulating the student list business.

<!--  CUT TEXT FROM OG INTRODUCTION

__Policy concerns__. Given that student lists profoundly affect student outcomes, the policy concerns are which students are being excluded from the underlying student list databases and which students are being excluded from student list purchases.  We argue that these policy concerns are primarily about student list products rather than how customers (universities) use these products.

Student list products exclude students in two ways. First, universities cannot purchase the contact information of prospects who are not included in the underlying database. While students who opt out of College Board Student Search Service are making a conscious decision, students cannot opt in unless they take a College Board Assessment (PSAT, SAT, AP). College Board and ACT assessments have been criticized for racial and socioeconomic bias [@RN6012; @RN6009; @RN6010; @RN0004; @RN0005]. Test-taking rates differ substantially across race and class [@RN0006], leading to systematic racial and socioeconomic inequality in which prospective students are included in the underlying databases that College Board and ACT student list products pull from. About 1.5 million students from the high school class of 2021 took the SAT compared to about 2.2 million students from the high school class of 2020 [@RN0007] and about 1.3 million student from the high school class of 2021 took the ACT compared to about 1.7 million students from the high school class of 2020. These declines were driven by the Covid Pandemic and by the growth in test-optional and test-blind admissions policies. To the extent that student lists are an important mechanism for college access, the test-optional movement may have the unintended consequence of creating a college access crisis, in which the long-term decline in test-takers leads to fewer prospective students included in College Board/ACT student list databases which causes college access to decline.

Second, student list products exclude students by creating filters that enable universities to purchase some names but not others. While universities choose filters based on their preferences, these choices are structured by what the product allows. We are concerned that several commonly used filters systematically exclude protected classes and other populations that are underrepresented in higher education (e.g., rural students). For example, College Board and ACT student list products enable universities to filter prospects by zip code, which is highly correlated with race. College Board allows universities to target prospects based on their score in some set of AP exams, but which students attend high schools with widespread access to AP classes? An emerging trend is the creation of "geodemographic" filters that enable universities to select prospects based on the past behavior of students from their high school or neighborhood (e.g., how many students from this school attended an out-of-state university?) [@RN2039; @RN0002]. Student list products enable universities to explicitly search for underrepresented groups (e.g., by race/ethnicity), but when used in conjunction with additional filters (e.g., test score range, high school characteristics) these searches tend to target more privileged members of the group.

# Background

This section provides relevant background information by situating student lists within the recruiting process, reviewing recent research on the relationship between student lists and student outcomes, and explaining how universities buy lists and what information they contain. We focus on lists sold by College Board, which are the focus of empirical analyses.

## Situating Student Lists within Recruiting

Similar to the visual metaphor of the "STEM pipeline," the "enrollment funnel" -- depicted in in Figure \@ref(fig:em-funnel) -- is a conceptual model used in the enrollment management industry to describes stages in the process of recruiting students. The funnel begins with a large pool of "prospects" that the university would like to convert into customers. "Leads" are prospects whose contact information has been purchased. "Inquiries" are prospects that contact your institution and consist of two types: first, inquiries who respond to an initial solicitation  (e.g., email) from the university; and second, "student as first contact" inquiries who reach out to the university on their own (e.g., by sending ACT scores). The funnel narrows at each successive stage -- inquiries, applicants, admits --  in order to convey the assumption of "melt" at each stage (e.g., a subset of "inquiries" will apply). Practically, the enrollment funnel informs interventions that increase the probability of "conversion" from one stage to another [@RN0001]. For example, financial aid packages convert admits to enrolled students.

```

At the top of the enrollment funnel, universities identify leads by buying "student lists." Sometimes referred to as “names,” student lists are the fundamental input for recruiting interventions that target individual prospects via mail, email, text, and on social media. The sum of purchased leads plus student-as-first-contact inquiries (e.g., filled out an online admissions inquiry form) constitutes the set of all prospects the university has contact information for, who are eligible to receive targeted recruiting interventions from the university. 

## Student Lists and Student Outcomes

Research suggests that student lists substantially affect college access outcomes -- and in turn degree completion outcomes -- for millions of students each year. @RN4739 compared SAT test-takers who opted into the College Board Student Search Service -- allowing accredited institutions to "licence" their contact information -- and test-takers who opted out, after controlling for covariates. Figure \@ref(fig:cb-fig) reproduces the main results. For students with the same values of SAT score, parental education, race/ethnicity, sex, high school graduation year, and who attended the same high school, 41.1\% of students who participated in Search attended a 4-year college compared to 32.8\% of students who opted out, representing an 8.3 (`=41.1-32.8`) percentage point difference and a 25.3 (`=(41.1-32.8)/32.8`) percent change in the relative probability of attending a 4-year college (for a similar analysis of ACT's Educational Opportunity Service (EOS) see @RN4752). 

Figure \@ref(fig:cb-fig) shows that participating in Search was associated with a larger percent change in the probability of attending a 4-year institution for students who identified as Black (24.5\%`=(39.6-31.8)/31.8`), Latinx (34.4\%), American Indian or Alaska Native (23.8\%), and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander (26.1\%) than it was for students who identified as White (21.6\%) or Asian (15.2\%). Similarly, the percent change in the probability of attending a four-year college was higher for students whose parents did not attend college (40.6\%) than it was for students whose parents had a BA (18.9\%).

Student lists may also affect degree completion through their effect on initial postsecondary institution. @RN4739 analyzed the four-year BA degree completion rates of SAT test-takers from the 2015 and 2016 high school graduation cohorts. Figure \@ref(fig:cb-fig) shows that 20.6\% of students who participated in Search obtained a BA in four years compared to 15.7\% of students who opted out, representing a 31.2\% (`=(20.6-15.7)/15.7`) increase in the relative probability of graduation. Furthermore, the relative increase in the probability of obtaining a BA was higher for Black (40.3\%), Hispanic (43.3\%), and Native American/Alaska Native students (48.3\%) than it was for White (27.9\%) and Asian (28.2\%) students. The relative increase was also higher for students whose parents did not attend college (50.0\%) than it was for students whose parents had a BA (25.3\%).


<!-- PREVIOUS VERSION OF TEXT

[@RN4739; @RN4752]. College Board encourages test takers to opt into the Colege Board Student Search Service, which enables "accredited colleges, universities, nonprofit scholarship programs, and nonprofit educational organizations" [@RN0003] to "license" their contact information. @RN4739 analyzed the college access and degree completion outcomes of SAT test-takers who graduated from high school between 2015-2018, comparing students who opted into Student Search Service to students who opted out. After controlling for covariates -- including gender/sex, race/ethnicity, parental education, SAT score, and high school -- 58.0\% of students who participated in Search attended any college compared to 50.2\% of students who opted out of Search, representing a 15.5\% relative increase in the probability of college enrollment ((58-50.2)/50.2=15.5).

Figure \@ref(fig:cb-fig) -- reproduced from @RN4739 -- presents results for four-year college enrollment and degree completion. 41.1\% of students who participated in Search attended a 4-year college compared to 32.8\% of students who opted out, representing a 25.3\% relative increase in the probability of attending a 4-year college. Furthermore, change in the relative probability of attending a four-year college associated with opting in to Search out was higher for students who identified as Black (24.5%), Hispanic (34.4%), American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) (23.8%), and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander (26.1\%) than it was for students who identified as White (21.6\%) or Asian (15.2\%). Similarly, change in the relative probability of attending a four-year college was higher for students whose parents did not attend college (40.6\%) than it was for students whose parents had a BA (18.9\%). 

With respect to BA degree completion, the bottom panel of Figure \@ref(fig:cb-fig) shows that 20.6\% of students who participated in Search obtained a BA compared within four years to 15.7\% of students who opted out, representing a relative increase of 31.2\%  ((20.6-15.7)/15.7=31.2). Additionally, the relative increase in the probability of obtaining a BA within four years was higher for Black, Hispanic, and AI/AN students than it was for White and Asian students and higher for first-generation students than for students whose parents had a BA.

A similar study compared the college access outcomes of students who opted into versus opted out of ACT's Educational Opportunity Service (EOS) [@RN4752]. EOS enables accredited postsecondary institutions and scholarship organizations to license the contact information of students who opt in. After controlling for covariates -- including ACT score, number of colleges the student sent scores to, family income, parental education, degree aspirations, race/ethnicity, state -- @RN4752 found that students who opted into EOS had a 3.7 times higher likelihood (odds ratio = $3.7$) of attending college than students who opted out. A second model, which restricted the sample to students who attended college, found that students who opted into EOS had 8.7\% higher odds of attending a four-year college rather than a two-year college.

The sample for completion outcomes is restricted to students in the 2015–2016 cohorts. Completion results are not reported for HI/PI students due to very small sample size (N=2,749), which returns imprecise estimates. Results are estimated from regressions that include student-level controls for: sex, race/ethnicity, SAT score, parental education level, last Student Search Service opt-in status, and graduation cohort and high school fixed effects. All differences between students whose names were licensed and those whose names were not licensed are statistically significant at the 1% level._

## Buying Student Lists

The largest student list vendors are College Board and ACT, which create student list products based on their database of test takers. College Board encourages test takers to opt into the "Student Search Service," which enables "accredited colleges, universities, nonprofit scholarship programs, and nonprofit educational organizations" [@cb_opt_in] to "license" their contact information. In fall 2021, the College Board Search product both charged \$0.50 per name [@RN0002]. 

How do universities purchase student lists from College Board Student Search Service and ACT's Encoura platform? Each purchased list is a subset of prospects drawn from the population of test-takers by specifying multiple search filters. @schmidt_2019 states that commonly specified search filters for ACT include high school graduation year, high school GPA, test score range (ACT or PreACT), gender, ethnicity, intended major, and geography (e.g., state, county, zip code) [@schmidt_2019] [CHANGE THIS EXAMPLE TO ACT]. As a hypothetical example, a university could purchase a student list from ACT that consisted of all prospects who scored between 30 and 34 on the ACT, have a GPA higher than 3.5, live in one of the top 10 metropolitan areas, and are in the high school senior class of 2023. As we discuss below, College Board and ACT recently began offering filters that enable universities to target prospects based on statistical models of the past behavior of similar or nearby prospects. [ADD LINKS/APPENDIX FIGURES SHOWING AVAILABLE SEARCH FILTERS FOR CB/ACT?]

What data do purchased student lists contain? Each purchased student list is essentially a spreadsheet that contains one row for each prospect that meets all criteria specified in the purchase. The columns of the student list include detailed contact information (name, address, email, cell phone) and detailed student characteristics derived from the pre-test questionnaire (e.g., ethnicity, race, gender, high school GPA, graduation year, high school code, intended major, first-generation status). The data template for an ACT student list can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rsP45OyOsnPYhV8uWYKDAy_spGhjj6aj/view) and the template for a College Board student list can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qvc_QRi9izEF1W78Lh4nNi5NsXjCZqUE/view). These fields represent a small subset of the information the testing agencies know about prospective students and contain little data about performance on assessments (e.g., SAT score). As we discuss below, College Board and ACT provide more detailed information to universities that pay for their enrollment management consulting services.


# Data Collection and Research Design

This section describes, first, the data collection for the broader project. Second, we describe the research methods for analyses of student list purchases from College Board, which are the focus of this report.

## Data Collection

In 2019 we received funding from the Joyce Foundation and the Kresge Foundation for a research project that would utilize public records requests to collect data about recruiting behavior from all public universities in four states, California, Illinois, Minnesota, and Texas. 

__Public records requests__. We used public records requests to collect data about student lists purchased by public universities. Following several months of planning and pilot requests, we began issuing public records requests in February 2020. We issued one records request letter to each public university in our data collection sample (described below). An example records request letter can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uVLwxmc9GnhOZOfsjSxQ_pVxKA0ASDRC/edit#). In subsequent communication we narrowed our request to student lists purchased from College Board, ACT, and the National Research Center for College and University Admissions (NRCCUA), the three largest student list vendors at the time.^[NRCCUA PURCHASED BY ACT AND IN YEAR X ACT RELEASED ENCOURA PRODUCT THAT INTEGRATED NAMES COLLECTED FROM NRCCUA MYCOLLEGE OPTIONS PRODUCT]

For each student list purchased from 2016 through 2020 for the purpose of undergraduate recruiting, we requested two related pieces of data: the order summary, which specifies search criteria for the student list purchase; and the de-identified prospect-level list produced from the search criteria. Figure X shows an example of a College Board order summary.^[Each recrods request letter also asked for data about off-campus recruiting visits] In Figure X, the university purchased the contact information of prospects who CRYSTAL ADD TEXT. Figure X shows partial data from the de-identified student list associated with this order. College Board student lists have one observation per prospect and contain variables for contact information (email and physical address), high school code, high school graduating class, demographic information, and selected information about college preferences (e.g., intended major) [CRYSTAL - ADD THESE FIGURES TO MAIN TEXT [order summary data](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/16HWujljYw8Hc2MetU8yADp2N3tQ_dywY), and [de-identified student list data](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/16HWujljYw8Hc2MetU8yADp2N3tQ_dywY)]. 

__Data collection sample__. The data collection sample consists of all public universities in IL, MN, CA, and TX. The IL higher education system includes 3 universities in the University of Illinois system, 7 in the Illinois State University system, and 2 in the Southern Illinois University system. In MN, there are 5 universities in the University of Minnesota system and 7 in the Minnesota State University system. In CA, there are 9 universities in the University of California system and 23 in the California State University system. In TX, there are 8 universities in the University of Texas system, 4 in the Texas State University system, 11 in the Texas A&M University system, 4 in the University of Houston system, 2 in the University of North Texas system, 2 in the Texas Tech University system, and 4 independent Texas universities. We also collected data from Arizona State University and Northern Arizona University.

Figures \@ref(fig:univ-carnegie) and \@ref(fig:univ-locale) describe the public universities in our data collection sample. A majority of the universities are master's or doctoral universities and located in urban areas. 

The Appendix discusses data collection challenges, successes, and lessons learned for future data collection efforts. Appendix Figure X-X reports the status of data collection for each university in the data collection sample.

__Secondary data__. Analyses incorporate several secondary data sources. Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) data provides characteristics of universities in the analysis sample. NCES Common Core of Data (CCD) and Private School Universe Survey (PSS), respectively, provides data about U.S. public and private high schools. The Census American Community Survey (ACS) provide data about community characteristics. We use zip-code level data from ACS 5-year estimates.


## Research Design

Decisions about research design and research questions depended substantially on the results of our data collection.

<!-- CUT TEXT
Each student list purchased from College Board is associated with (1) an "order summary" of the search filters specified in the purchase (e.g., high school graduating class, test score range) and (2) the prospect-level student list produced by these search filters. 
-->
__Analysis sample__. This report analyzes student lists purchased from College Board. Table \@ref(tab:received-data) shows the number of public universities in our data collection sample that provided usable data about (1) student list order summaries and (2) de-identified student lists purchased from College Board. [CRYSTAL/KARINA - ARE THESE NUMBERS RIGHT?]. The results presented below are based on data received from `r num_univs` universities that provided usable order summary data and usable student list data.

Table \@ref(tab:purchased-data) summarizes the number of order summaries received and the number of prospects purchased across the `r num_univs` universities. We received order summaries for `r num_orders` student list purchases, including XXXX purchases where we also received the associated prospect-level student list data and XXXX purchases where we did not receive the associated prospect-level list data. 

We received prospect-level student list data for `r num_lists` student list purchases, including XXXXX purchases where we also received the associated order summary and XXXXX purchases where we did not receive the order summary. There were XXXX prospects in these `r num_lists` student list purchases, including XXXX prospects from purchases where we also received the associated order summary and XXXX prospects from the purchases where we did not receive the associated order summary. [CRYSTAL/KARINA - FILL IN NUMBERS IN TEXT IN THS PARAGRAPH AND ABOVE; ALSO NUMBERS DON'T MATCH BETWEEN TEXT AND TABLE]

Figure \@ref(fig:purchased-orders-carnegie) shows the number of student lists purchased by Carnegie Classification and state. Figure \@ref(fig:purchased-prospects-carnegie) shows the number of prospects purchased by Carnegie Classification and state.

Figure \@ref(fig:orders-purchased) presents the `r num_orders` total orders analyzed in this report by university type and total students purchased. The `r num_orders` orders were purchased across `r num_univs` universities. The `r num = sum(orders_fig_totals$carnegie == "Master's"); ifelse(num < 10, words(num), num)` master's universities in the study made the majority of order purchases (N=`r sum((orders_fig_totals %>% filter(carnegie == "Master's"))$total_orders)`), while research universities made `r sum((orders_fig_totals %>% filter(carnegie == "Research"))$total_orders)` orders and the only baccalaureate university in the study made one order. 

The number of total prospects purchased within each order varied widely. Across all `r num_orders` orders, the median number of prospects purchased per order was `r prettyNum(median(orders_df$num_students, na.rm = T), ',')`, whereas the mean was `r prettyNum(round(mean(orders_df$num_students, na.rm = T)), ',')` (sd=`r prettyNum(round(sd(orders_df$num_students, na.rm = T)), ',')`). Despite making fewer total orders than master's universities, research universities on average purchased nearly double the number of students per order (`r prettyNum(round(mean((orders_df %>% filter(carnegie == "Research"))$num_students, na.rm = T)), ',')` versus `r prettyNum(round(mean((orders_df %>% filter(carnegie == "Master's"))$num_students, na.rm = T)), ',')`).

__Research questions and analyses__. Choices about research questions were informed by data limitations and by substantive considerations. Because we received order summary data and student list data from a non-random sample of universities, we utilize a multiple case study research design [@RN4116] rather than a large-N statistical design. Therefore, our analysis sample identifies behaviors that exist in the population of public universities, but not the prevalence of these behaviors in the population.

More substantively, analyses should also focus on student list products themselves, not just the behavior of customers (universities) who buy the product. Systematic inequality in purchased versus excluded names is a function of: (A) which prospective students are included in the underlying data base; (B) the set of filters that universities can utilize to select prospects; and finally (C) university choices about which filters to select. Therefore, analyses should investigate the relationship between the filters chosen for a particular student list purchase and who is included in the resulting student list.

<!--
Prospective students who do not take College Board assessments are excluded from College Board lists. College Board filters encourage customers to purchase prospects based on their score ranges in SAT, PSAT, and AP assessments, but which students attends high schools with widespread access to AP classes? Geographic filters additionally enable to customers to filter prospects based zip code. which is highly correlated by race. More recently, College Board has created "geodemographic" filters that target prospects based on the recent college-going behaviors of nearby peers. 
-->
The empirical analyses presented in this report are guided by three research questions, which focus on student lists purchased from College Board:

1. Which filter criteria were selected in student lists purchased by universities in our sample?
1. What are the characteristics of prospects included in student lists purchased by universities in our sample?
1. What is the relationship between student list filter criteria and the characteristics of purchased prospects?

In RQ1 the unit of analysis is the order or university-order. Analyses allow us to make statements about how orders vary -- within-university variation and between-university variation -- for universities in our sample. In RQ2 the unit of analysis is university-prospect. Analyses allow us to make statements about the characteristics of prospects targeted by universities in our sample. In RQ3 the unit of analysis is order-prospect. Analyses allow us to make statements about the relationship between filter criteria and prospect characteristics that extend to lists purchased by any university that select similar filter criteria.

Empirical analyses consist of simple descriptive statistics presented in tables, figures, and maps. For each research question, analyses are anchored by a small set of tables or figures that present results for the entire analysis sample. Next, we present analyses of selected universities, purchases and/or localities that convey commonly observed or thematically important patterns, with a focus on the nexus between race, class, and geography. For RQ2 and RQ3, we contextualize the characteristics of purchased prospects by showing the characteristics of one or more comparison groups (e.g., all high school graduates in the metropolitan area).

# Results  

## RQ1: Filter Criteria Selected in Purchases 

Research question 1 asks, which filter criteria were selected in student lists purchased by universities in our sample? We first describe broad pattens in filters used by research vs. ma/doctoral universities. The filters commonly used by universities in our sample can be categorized into three groups: academic (e.g., GPA, PSAT, SAT, academic rank, AP Score); geographic (e.g., zip code, state, segment, core based statistical area, geomarket, international); and demographic (e.g., race/ethnicity, gender). Next, we describe patterns observed, for academic, geographic, and demographic filters, respectively, and how filters are used in combination.


<!-- Some geographic filters are metrics created by the College Board. For example, segment filters come from the College Board’s “Segment Analysis Service” which merges demographic, geographic, and academic data on SAT test takers to create "geodemographic profiles" for college-bound students (The College Board, 2011, p. 3). These profiles are created at the neighborhood-level and at the school-level. Geomarket filters are also created by the College Board within Enrollment Management Services, which uses information about SAT score senders from the past five admissions cycles within a specific geographic locality (e.g., counties, metropolitan areas, cities) to make projections about high high school graduates in the area [CITE].  -->

### Broad Patterns

Figure \@ref(fig:orders-filters) shows how often filters were used by university type. Note that student list purchases typically filter on multiple criteria. Figure X shows the prevalence of individual filters, not how often they are used in combination with other filters.

All orders by both research universities (n = 377) [CHECK] and ma/doctoral universities (n = 458) filtered by high school graduation class. Commonly used academic filters across university type include GPA, SAT, and PSAT. Compared to ma/doctoral universities, research universities were somewhat less likely to filter on GPA or SAT score and more likely to filter on PSAT score. Additionally, research universities filtered on high school class rank (12% of orders) and AP score (10% of orders), but few ma/doctoral orders utilzied these filters.

Orders by ma/doctoral versus research universities differed across geographic filters. Nearly 77% of orders by research universities used a state filter but only 11% of orders by ma/doctoral universities filtered for entire states. 83% of orders by ma/doctoral universities used a zip-code filter. However, it is worth noting that most of these orders came from one doctoral university that recruits out-of-state students extensively. By contrast, Research universities in our sample did not use zip code filters. However, research universities also filtered by geomarket (16%), segment (12%), core based statistical area (4%), and international status (4%), whereas ma/doctoral universities generally did not.

Finally, ma/doctoral universities did not utilize demographic filters. For research universities, about 27% or orders filtered by students' race/ethnicity and 6% of orders filtered on gender.

### Academic Filters

The three most commonly used academic filters (GPA, PSAT, SAT) were used by specifying a "low/minimum" and a "high/maximum" threshold. Across university type, nearly all orders that filtered on GPA used a high threshold of "A+." ^[The only exception is one order by a research university that used a GPA high of A-] However, Figure X shows that research and ma/doctoral universities differed in the specified low threshold for orders filtering by GPA.  For research universities, low GPA thresholds ranged from A+ to B-, with the majority of orders using a low of B- (46%) or B (33%). ma/doctoral universities' orders used low GPA thresholds that ranged from A to C-, with more than half of these orders specifying a low between C- and C+.  

Figure X shows minimum and maximum thresholds used in SAT score filters and figure X shows thresholds for PSAT score. Although substantial overlap exists across university type, research universities tended to specify higher minimum score thresholds and higher maximum score threshoulds compared to ma/doctoral universities. In Figure X, for example, X% of orders by research universities specified a minimum SAT score of 1110 compared to X% of orders by ma/doctoral. X% of orders by research universities specified a maximum SAT score of 1310 or higher compared to X% of orders by ma/doctoral.  Interestingly,  7% of ma/doctoral universities' SAT filter orders indicated a minimum SAT score threshold of 1500+, whereas research universities made zero orders at that minimum threshold. These 21 orders were made by two different ma/doctoral universities targeting prospects for specific scholarship programs.

```{r orders-gpa}
table_gpa %>% 
  mutate(
    pct_low = str_c(sprintf('%.1f', pct_low), '%'),
    pct_high = if_else(is.na(pct_high), '', str_c(sprintf('%.1f', pct_high), '%'))
  ) %>% 
  kable(booktabs = T, col.names = c('GPA', '# low', '% low', '# high', '% high'), align = c('l', rep('c', 4)), caption = 'Filter by GPA') %>% 
  row_spec(0, bold = T) %>%
  kable_styling(position = 'center')
```


### Geographic filters

The research universities in our sample used different geographic filters than the ma/doctoral universities in our sample. About 77% of orders by research universities filtered on state. These orders filtered on multiple states or on a single state. Orders that filtered on multiple states were used to target out-of-state prospects. The majority of single-state orders were used to target in-state prospects. However, single-state orders to target out-of-state prospects in populous states (e.g., CA) were also common. 

Figure X shows orders by research universities that filtered on state, with separate maps for orders that filtered on out-of-state prospects and in-state prospects. CA, TX, and IL were the most commonly filtered states by universities searching for out-of-state prospects. Orders for out-of-state prospects tended to avoid less populous and less affluent states. 

Aside from state, research universities also filtered on other geographic filters created by College Board, including "geomarkets" (16% of orders), "segment" (12% of orders), CBSA (4%), and 4% of order targeted international prospects. Geomarket filters are created by the College Board within their Enrollment Management Services, which use information about SAT score senders from the past five admissions cycles within a specific geographic locality (e.g., counties, metropolitan areas, cities) to make projections about high school graduates in the area [CITE]. 

Segment filters come from the College Board’s “Segment Analysis Service,” which categorizes each high school and each neighborhood (census tract) into a type based on its demographic, geographic, academic, historical college-going characteristics [@RN2039]. Universities can then filter on prospects who attend a particular "type" of high school and/or live in a particular "type" of neighborhood. We analyze Segment orders in more detail in Research Question 3, below.

The geographic filters most commonly used by ma/doctoral universities in our sample were state and home zip code. 11% of orders by ma/doctoral universities filtered on state. These orders [ALWAYS?] were used to taget in-state prospects. 83% of orders by ma/doctoral universities filtered on home zip code, but orders by research universities did not filter in zip code.

Zip code filters were used by ma/doctoral universities in two different ways. In the first approach, universities filtered for three-digit zip codes. Three digit zip codes are prefixes for all five-digit zip codes that fall within a postal service sectional center facility, many of which serve large metropolitan areas within one state but can sometimes serve multiple states. XX of XX orders that filtered on zip code filtered on three-digit zip codes. Orders using three-digit zip codes tended to target areas within the state where the university resides and sometimes in neighboring states, which is likely a function of ma/doctoral universities targeting prospective students in their local regions. Figure X shows a map of three-digit zip codes filtered by a TX public university [OZAN SAYS INCLUDE]

```{r orders-zip, fig.height = 4, fig.cap = 'Filter by 3-digit zip code'}
zip_shp_purchased <- subset(zip_shp, str_detect(ZCTA5CE10, str_c('^', orders_df$zip_code %>% na.omit() %>% unique() %>% str_split('\\|') %>% unlist(), collapse = '|')))

leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>% 
  addPolygons(data = zip_shp_purchased, stroke = F, fillOpacity = 0.8, smoothFactor = 0.2, color = 'gray')
```


In the second approach, universities specified a list of five-digit zip codes. Usually, five-digit zip codes were specified in a separate spreadsheet or text file that universities provided to College Board. XX (N=381) of XX orders that filtered on zip code filtered on five-digit zip codes. We know the five-digit zip-codes for XXX of these orders. [CAN WE SAY WHETHER THESE TENDED TO BE IN-STATE?]For the remaining XXX orders (n=157 orders), we were unable to obtain the zip-code file despite multiple requests. 

One doctoral university gave us order summaries for XXX (?136?) student lists they purchased from College Board in in XXXX (?2019 and 2020). XXX of these orders specified five-digit zip codes. While we were unable to obtain the zip code files, the names on these orders (e.g., 'Midwest/South II 950-1040 Srs (20)', 'West II Srs (20) AP 3-5') suggests that most of these orders targeted out-of-state five-digit zip codes.

Filtering by geography always raises equality of opportunity concerns for prospects who do not reside in the targeted geography. Filtering by five-digit zip code is particularly concerning because there is no equality of opportunity rationale for targeting students who live in one zip code but not those from a neighboring zip code. Zip codes are highly correlated with income and racial demographics. Therefore, policymakers may be concerned that some universities are systematically excluding low-income communities or communities of color when they filter on five-digit zip code.


```{r orders-state}
orders_df %>%
  filter(nchar(state_name) > 0) %>% 
  mutate(
    state_name = case_when(
      str_detect(state_name, '\\|') ~ 'Multi-state', 
      state_name == 'California' ~ 'CA', 
      state_name == 'Texas' ~ 'TX', 
      state_name == 'Illinois' ~ 'IL', 
      T ~ state_name
    )
  ) %>% 
  group_by(univ_state, state_name) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count)) %>% 
  kable(booktabs = T, col.names = c('University state', 'Purchased state(s)', 'Count'), align = rep('c', 3), caption = 'Filter by state') %>% 
  row_spec(0, bold = T) %>%
  kable_styling(position = 'center')
```



### Demographic Filters

Nearly all orders using demographic filters were made by research universities. Figure X shows the number of orders that used a race/ethnicity filter. Most of the 103 orders using race/ethnicity filters specified multiple race/ethnicity groups. This includes 19 orders that filtered by Black, Native American, or Latinx prospects and 19 orders that filtered for Asian, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and White prospects. Other common race/ethnicity filter combinations include Latinx, Black, Native American, and NativeHawaii/PI (11 orders);  Asian and White (10 orders); and Latinx and Native American (7 orders). Fewer orders filtered for only one race/ethnicity group, including 12 orders filtering for Latinx prospects, 7 orders filtering for Black prospects, and 10 orders filtering for Native American prospects (American Indian, Alaska Native, and/or Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander) [CLEAN UP SENTENCE NOT ALL OF THESE GROUPS ARE NATIVE AMERICAN. AND NOT CLEAR WHETHER THESE ORDERS FILTERED FOR SPECIFIC GROUP OR FILTERED FOR EITHER]. 

Research universities also made `r (orders_filters1 %>% filter(filters == 'gender'))$V1` orders using gender filters. Across these orders, `r (gender %>% filter(gender == 'Female'))$pct`% filtered for women prospects and `r (gender %>% filter(gender != 'Female'))$pct`% filtered men prospects. 


### Combination of Filters

On average, the (N=XXX) orders in our dataset specified X.X critereia. Table \@ref(tab:orders-filter-combos) shows the ten most commonly used combinations of filters across orders by research (N=377) and ma/doctoral (N=458). [STATE SOMEWHERE THAT SOME FILTER IN THESE COMBINATIONS AREUSED AS **OR** CONDITIONS RATHER THAN **AND** CONDITIONS?]. 

For research universities, the top ten filter combinations account for 71% of all orders.  The most common filter combination used included high school graduation class, state, and PSAT scores (n=47). These filters were also used across the top three combinations. For 41 [NUMBERS SEEM OFF IN PARAGRAH?] orders, high school graduation class, state, and PSAT scores were combined with race and gpa filters. Another 39 orders added race, gpa, SAT, and high school rank. The fourth and fifth most common combinations switched PSAT scores for SAT scores. The remaining common filter combinations across orders by research universities used other academic filters (e.g., high school rank, AP scores) and geographical filters (e.g., geomarkets, segment). 


For ma/doctoral universities, the top 10 filter combinations account for 97% of all orders. This is a function of nearly half of all orders using a combination of high school graduation class, zip, SAT scores, and GPA to filter prospect lists. Another 32% of orders used these same filters but used PSAT scores rather than SAT scores. Other orders by ma/doctoral universities used similar patterns of filters by using all three top academic filters together (PSAT, SAT, and GPA) or switching zip codes for a state filter.

The results for Research Question 3 investigates the student characteristics associated with particular combinations of filters.

```{r orders-filter-combos}
df_0 %>%

  mutate(pct = str_c(pct, '%')) %>% 
  kable(booktabs = T, col.names = c('Filters', 'Count', 'Percent'), align = c('l', 'c', 'c'), caption = 'Filter combos used in order purchases') %>% 
  row_spec(0, bold = T) %>%
  kable_styling(position = 'center')
```

<!-- About `r (df_0 %>% filter(string == 'grad_class,state,race,sat,psat,gpa,rank'))$pct`% of orders (`r (df_0 %>% filter(string == 'grad_class,state,race,sat,psat,gpa,rank'))$n` of `r num_orders`) used high school graduation class, state, sat, psat, gpa, and class rank filters while specifying for the race/ethnicity of prospects. The second most commonly used filter combination that specified the race/ethnicity of prospects includes `r (df_0 %>% filter(string == 'grad_class,state,race,psat,gpa'))$n` orders that used it in combination with graduation class, state, PSAT, and GPA filters.  -->

<!-- The remaining combinations followed similar general patterns in targeting both the academic and geographical characteristics of prospects as the top combinations described above; however, they used other types of filters (e.g., gender, AP scores, segment, geomarket). `r Words((df_0 %>% filter(string == 'grad_class,state,segment,gender,sat,psat,gpa'))$n)` orders used graduation class, state, SAT, PSAT, and GPA filters in combination with segment and gender. Orders that used the segment filter used both neighborhood and high school clusters. For example, one specific order included a filter for census tracts assigned to neighborhood cluster 51, but further filtered by only including prospects from schools assigned to high school clusters 65, 68, 70, and 79 were included.  -->

<!-- `r Words((df_0 %>% filter(string == 'grad_class,state,gpa,APscores'))$n)` orders used graduation class, state, GPA in combination with APscores. AP score filters tended to be grouped into "fields" and varied across score thresholds. Most orders targeted prospects scoring from 3-5 on AP exams in either STEM fields (e.g., Physics, Calculus, Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science) or Humanities and Fine Arts (e.g., Spanish, French, Art History, Music Theory), although some STEM orders filtered for prospects scoring a 4 or 5 on their AP exans.  -->

<!-- Lastly, `r words((df_0 %>% filter(string == 'grad_class,sat,geomarket'))$n)` orders used graduation class, SAT, and geomarket. These orders filtered for geomarkets within Texas and Louisiana. Louisiana geomarket orders targeted prospects in the Baton Rouge and Shreveport areas. Texas geomarkets filtered for include but are not limited to the Dallas/Ft. Worth areas, Central Gulf Coast, Wharton County, Victoria County, City of San Antonio, Southwest Houston Metropolitan Area, Brazos and Trinity Valley, Austin and Central Texas, Galveston area, East Texas.  -->


## RQ2: Characteristics of Prospects 

Research Question 2 asks, What are the characteristics of prospects included in student lists purchased by universities in our sample?
Our analysis on the characteristics of prospects purchased by universities includes `r num_lists` orders resulting in `r prettyNum(num_prospects, ',')` prospects. Figure \@ref(fig:prospects-count) shows the total number of prospects by public versus ma/doctoral universities, focusing on domestic students. Research universities in the study purchased nearly four times the number of prospects (N= 2,785,481) than ma/doctoral universities (N=764,334).

Figure \@ref(fig:prospects-count) also shows the number of prospects purchased by in-state versus out-of-state across institutional type.  Research universities purchased many more out-of-state students than ma/doctoral universities. For example, of the nearly `r round(df_rq2a_totals$research_univ / 1e6, 1)` Million prospects purchased by research universities,  `r round(df_rq2a_totals$research_univ_outofstate / df_rq2a_totals$research_univ * 100)`% were out-of-state. In comparison, only only `r round(df_rq2a_totals$regional_univ_outofstate / df_rq2a_totals$regional_univ * 100)`% of ma/doctoral universities nearly `r prettyNum(round(df_rq2a_totals$regional_univ / 1000) * 1000, ',')` prospects were out-of-state students. 

Below we describe the racial, economic, and geographical characteristics of prospect lists purchased by research and ma/doctoral universities. 

```{r prospects-count, fig.height = 2.5, fig.cap = 'Number of prospects purchased'}
df_rq2a_counts <- df_rq2a %>%

### Public Research Universities

Figure \@ref(fig:prospects-race) presents the racial characteristics of prospects from lists purchased by research university across in-state versus out-of-state status. Race/ethnicity of prospects is collected from the College Board's voluntary demographic questionnaire completed by students when taking the SAT; therefore, we report racial characteristics as self-identified and include the percentage of students that did not report their race/ethnicity. 

Out-of-state prospects in lists purchased by research universities had a larger proportion of White and Asian students and lower proportions of Black, Latinx, and Native American students than lists for in-state prospects. For example, when research universities in the study made order purchases for prospects residing in different states than where their campus is located, these lists resulted in prospect lists made up of `r round(df_rq2a_outofstate[['Pct White']])`% White students, `r round(df_rq2a_outofstate[['Pct Asian']])`% Asian students, `r round(df_rq2a_outofstate[['Pct Latinx']])`% Latinx students, `r round(df_rq2a_outofstate[['Pct Black']])`% Black, `r round(df_rq2a_outofstate[['Pct Multiracial']])`% multiracial, and `r round(df_rq2a_outofstate[['Pct Race-No Response']])`% no response. In comparison, purchases for prospects residing in the same state as the institution's campus results in lists made up of `r round(df_rq2a_instate[['Pct White']])`% White students, `r round(df_rq2a_instate[['Pct Asian']])`% Asian, `r round(df_rq2a_instate[['Pct Latinx']])`% Latinx, `r round(df_rq2a_instate[['Pct Black']])`% Black, `r round(df_rq2a_instate[['Pct Multiracial']])`% multiracial, and `r round(df_rq2a_instate[['Pct Race-No Response']])`% of students that did not report their race/ethnicity. 

Figure \@ref(fig:prospects-income) presents the average median income of the zip code where in-state versus out-of-state prospects live for lists purchased by research universities. The figure shows out-of-state prospects tend to be more affluent than in-state prospects. For example, when research universities in the study purchased lists for prospects residing in different states than where their campus is located, these lists resulted in prospects that live in areas where the average median household income is \$`r prettyNum(round(df_rq2a_outofstate[['Median Household Income (mean)']] / 1000) * 1000, ',')`. In comparison, purchases for prospects residing in the same state as the institution's campus resulted in prospects that live in areas where the average median household income is \$`r prettyNum(round(df_rq2a_instate[['Median Household Income (mean)']] / 1000) * 1000, ',')`.  

<!-- While out-of-state prospect lists included a larger proportion of White and Asian students, these orders also include a critical mass of nearly 8,000 Native American students that can be glossed over when only looking at overall proportions.  Check above number -->

<!-- The differences in the racial characteristics of in-state versus out-of-state prospects are likely also a function of purchases made by research versus master's universities. While research universities made more out-of-state than in-state prospect purchases, the differences in the racial characteristics of both groups were relatively small in comparison to purchases by master's universities. For example, White students made up `r round(df_rq2a_research_outofstate[['Pct White']])`% and `r round(df_rq2a_research_instate[['Pct White']])`% of out-of-state and in-state prospect lists purchased by research universities, respectively. In comparison, White students made up `r round(df_rq2a_regional_outofstate[['Pct White']])`% of out-of-state prospect lists and only `r round(df_rq2a_regional_instate[['Pct White']])`% of in-state prospect lists purchased by master's universities. However, purchases by master's universities also included a much larger proportion of students that did not report their race/ethnicity.  -->

```

We also analyze the urbanicity characteristics of prospects in list purchased by research universities. Figure X shows...


### Public ma/doctoral Universities 

Figure \@ref(fig:prospects-race) presents the racial characteristics of prospects from lists purchased by ma/doctoral university across in-state versus out-of-state status. Similar to research universities, a greater proportion of out-of-state prospects in lists purchased by ma/doctoral universities were White (43%) relative to in-state prospects (35%), although greater number of prospects in lists purchased by ma/doctoral universities did not report their race/ethnicity. While disparities for Asian, Black, and Native American prospects across out-of-state versus in-state list purchases by were not as large relative to research universities, out-of-state prospects in lists purchased by ma/doctoral universities included a much lower percentage of Latinx students (9%) than in-state lists (22%). 


Contrary to prospect characteristics in lists purchased by research universities, out-of-state prospects in lists purchased by ma/doctoral universities on average live in less affluent areas than in-state prospects. However, the magnitude in differences across median average household incomes is smaller across purchased for ma/doctoral universities. For example, Figure \@ref(fig:prospects-income) shows out-of-state prospects live in areas where the average median household income is \$`r prettyNum(round(df_rq2a_outofstate[['Median Household Income (mean)']] / 1000) * 1000, ',')` in comparison to \$`r prettyNum(round(df_rq2a_instate[['Median Household Income (mean)']] / 1000) * 1000, ',')` for in-state prospects.

```

We also analyze the urbanicity characteristics of prospects in list purchased by research universities. Figure X shows...



<!-- ### High Schools Attended -->

<!-- Given some of the College Board products link individual prospects to high schools for services like high school segment clusters, we are able to analyze some of the characteristics of high schools purchased prospects attend. -->

<!-- Figure \@ref(fig:prospects-hs) presents school type for purchased prospects by in-state versus out-of-state status for research and master's university purchases. Overall, `r round(df_rq2a_domestic[['Pct Public']])`% of prospects purchased attend public high schools, `r round(df_rq2a_domestic[['Pct Private']])`% attend private schools, and `r round(df_rq2a_domestic[['Pct School Unknown']])`% did not report their high school. While these overall proportions are comparable to national averages, there are several differences across in-state versus out-of-state purchases by research and master's universities. For research universities, students attending private high schools made up a greater share of out-of-state prospect lists (`r round(df_rq2a_research_outofstate[['Pct Private']])`%) than in-state lists purchases (`r round(df_rq2a_research_instate[['Pct Private']])`%). Student list purchases by master's universities also exhibited this pattern, where private high school students made up `r round(df_rq2a_regional_outofstate[['Pct Private']])`% of out-of-state prospects versus `r round(df_rq2a_regional_instate[['Pct Private']])`% of in-state prospects purchased. -->

<!-- ### International Prospects -->

<!-- Nearly 100,000 of the 2 Million prospects purchased were international students. Table \@ref(tab:prospects-intl) presents the countries from which these prospects were purchased, with XYZ representing the total number of prospects purchased by country. The top ten countries, which account for more than 60% of international prospects purchased across the `r num_lists` orders, include India (`r round((df_int %>% filter(stu_country == 'india'))$pct)`%), China (`r round((df_int %>% filter(stu_country == 'china'))$pct)`%), Singapore (`r round((df_int %>% filter(stu_country == 'singapore'))$pct)`%), South Korea (`r round((df_int %>% filter(stu_country == 'south korea'))$pct)`%), Canada (`r round((df_int %>% filter(stu_country == 'canada'))$pct)`%), United Arab Emirates (`r round((df_int %>% filter(stu_country == 'united arab emirates'))$pct)`%), Pakistan (`r round((df_int %>% filter(stu_country == 'pakistan'))$pct)`%), Taiwan (`r round((df_int %>% filter(stu_country == 'taiwan'))$pct)`%), Saudi Arabia (`r round((df_int %>% filter(stu_country == 'saudi arabia'))$pct)`%), and Thailand (`r round((df_int %>% filter(stu_country == 'thailand'))$pct)`%). -->

## Filter Criteria and Characteristics of Prospects

We analyze the relationship between filter criteria and the characteristics of purchased prospects in two different ways. First, we analyze prospect characteristics (e.g., race/ethnicity, income, in-state versus out-of-state) across individual filters to understand broad patterns. Second, we analyze prospect characteristics across common combinations of filters. Here we use selected universities, purchases and/or localities that convey commonly observed or thematically important patterns across combinations of filters. We also contextualize the characteristics of purchased prospects by showing the characteristics of one or more comparison groups based on the selected examples.

### Prospect Characteristics Across Individual Filters

Table \@ref(tab:prospects-filters) presents the characteristics of prospects by individual filters. For each column, averages are reported across all prospects that were purchased via orders using the specified column filter, which includes orders that used the specified filter in combination with other filters. ^[Given we present all prospects across individual filters that are used in combination with others, total number of prospects summed across columns will exceed our grand total of `r prettyNum(num_prospects, ',')` prospects]

Focusing on the racial characteristics of prospects, student lists with the largest percentages of White and Asian prospects result when orders use PSAT, gender, segment, or CBSA filters. For example, orders that specify a gender filter result in prospect lists that are less than 10% Black, Latinx, and/or Native American. <!-- Check: df_rq3_gender[['Pct Black']] + df_rq3_gender[['Pct Latinx']] + df_rq3_gender[['Pct AI/AN']] --> This pattern is consistent in prospect lists that use segment or CBSA filters, although the disparity is not as large for orders using a PSAT filter (`r round(df_rq3_psat[['Pct Black']] + df_rq3_psat[['Pct Latinx']] + df_rq3_psat[['Pct AI/AN']])`% Black, Latinx, Native America).  On the other hand, orders that filter by specifying particular race/ethnicity groups result in lists that have fewer White and Asian prospects and greater proportions of Black, Latinx, Native American, and multiracial prospects. <!-- Check: round(df_rq3_race[['Pct White']] + df_rq3_race[['Pct Asian']]) vs. round(df_rq3_race[['Pct Black']] + df_rq3_race[['Pct Latinx']] + df_rq3_race[['Pct AI/AN']] + df_rq3_race[['Pct Multiracial']]) --> This coincides with descriptive findings above that suggest more than half of all orders using a race/ethnicity filter specified Black, Native American, and/or Latinx prospects.

```{r prospects-filters}
df_rq3 %>% 
  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, 0) %>% 
  mutate_each(funs(prettyNum(., big.mark = ','))) %>% 
  kable(booktabs = T, col.names = c('', 'All domestic', 'GPA', 'PSAT', 'SAT', 'HS rank', 'Race', 'Gender', 'Zip code', 'State', 'Segment', 'CBSA'), align = c('l', rep('c', 11)), caption = 'Characteristics of prospects by filters') %>% 
  row_spec(0, bold = T) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = 'scale_down')
```

Similar disparities are evident across the economic characteristics of prospect lists by filters used. Orders using PSAT, gender, segment, or CBSA filters result in prospect lists with the largest average median household incomes. Orders using a CBSA filter showcase the upper extreme of this pattern, resulting in lists where the average prospect lived in a zipcode where the median household income \$`r prettyNum(round(df_rq3_cbsa[['Median Household Income (mean)']] / 1000) * 1000, ',')`. Similarly, orders using race/ethnicity filters showcased the lower extreme. When universities purchased orders that filtered for specific race/ethnicity groups, the resulting lists included prospects that lived in zip codes where the average median household income was less than $`r prettyNum(round(df_rq3_race[['Median Household Income (mean)']] / 1000) * 1000, ',')`. 

Not surprisingly, orders using geographic filters result in specific patterns of in-state versus out-of-state prospects. However, analyzing the residency status of prospect lists across filters can help us develop insights into how specific filters are used to target prospects geographically. For example, orders using segment and CBSA filters are likely used for targeting out-of-state students, as the use of these filters result in prospect lists made up of `r round(df_rq3_segment[['Pct Out-of-State']])`% and `r round(df_rq3_cbsa[['Pct Out-of-State']])`% out-of-state prospects, respectively. However, orders filtering for prospects within specific state(s) result in list that are nearly equal proportions of out-of-state and in-state students. Coinciding with descriptive statistics detailed above and data limitations (i.e., we only received zip codes used to filter order lists by two master's universities in our sample), nearly `r round(df_rq3_zip[['Pct In-State']])`% of prospects resulting from orders using a zip code filter were in-state students. Similar to disparities in racial and economic characteristics of prospects, orders using a gender filter also resulted in geographical disparities (`r round(df_rq3_gender[['Pct Out-of-State']])`% out-of-state versus `r round(df_rq3_gender[['Pct In-State']])`% in-state).  

Lastly, Table \@ref(tab:prospects-filters) shows the difference in proportions of prospects that attend public versus private schools does not change significantly across filters used. For example, orders that specify a CBSA result in student lists where on average `r round(df_rq3_cbsa[['Pct Private']])`% of prospects attend private schools, which is the maximum proportion across all filters. In comparison, orders that use zip code filter result in students lists with the minimum proportion of prospects attending private schools (`r round(df_rq3_zip[['Pct Private']])`%).


### Prospect Characteristics Across Combinations of Filters

### ma/doctoral Zip Codes & Test Scores

We begin analyzing the characteristics of prospects across some of the most common combination of filters. Many of the orders in our analysis filtered by high school graduation class, PSAT scores, GPA, and zip code. Figure \@ref(fig:orders-zip) and analyses above suggest orders using this combination of filters were made by master's universities to identify in-state and ma/doctoral prospects. We "zoom" into orders by one of these master's universities, Texas A & M University- Texerkana, in order analyze in-depth patterns in the racial and economic characteristics of prospects that result from this combination of filters. 

Texas A & M University- Texerkana made 65 orders using graduation class, PSAT scores, GPA, and zip code filters. These orders targeted 2019-2022 high school graduating classes with minimum PSAT scores ranging from 920-1300 and maximum SAT scores ranging from 970-1450. The university also filtered for prospects with GPAs ranging from a low of C+ to a high of A+. Lastly, prospects were also filtered using a series of 3-digit zip codes that included both in-state and neighboring state zip codes. 

<!-- Nine of the 65 orders targeted students living in Texas (Greenville, Denton, Palestine, Lufkin, and Tyler areas), although orders also included neighboring state zip codes in Arkansas (Camden and Hot Springs areas), Oklahoma (Durant area), and Louisiana (Monroe and Shreveport areas). Another 13 orders targeted these same areas in addition to prospects in the Conroe, Richmond, and Pasadena areas of Texas. Twenty-seven orders focused on targeting prospects in zip codes for the Texerkana (Texas and Arkansas), Dallas, Fort-Worth, and Long View areas. Lastly, 16 orders targeted prospects only in the Houston, Conroe, Richmond and Pasadena areas.  -->

For each three-digit zip code used as an order filter, we compare the average racial and economic characteristics of the resulting purchased prospects to the zip code's population of 15-19 year-olds. We select the zip code population as the comparison group for purchase prospects filtered by graduation class, PSAT scores, GPA, and zip code filters for various reasons. First, the university included a three-digit zip code filter which encapsulates all students living within in a specified area (usually a City or County), which should hypothetically cast a wider, more equitable net than filtering explicitly by 5-digit zip codes. However, we analyze whether this wider net is compromised when it is used along with test scores and GPA. Secondly, master's universities are like to serve ma/doctoral student markets, rather than the entire state where they are located. Therefore, we use a filtered zip code's population as a comparison group for prospects purchased within that zip code rather than all zip codes in the state from which prospects were not purchased from. 

For example, the three-digit zip code 752 was included in 27 of the 65 orders that filtered across graduation class, PSAT scores, GPA and zip code. The 49 five-digit zip codes nested within the three-digit 752 zip code includes communities across the Dallas metropolitan area (see Figure X). The student lists for these orders resulted in 8,707 purchased prospects living in one of the 47 five-digit zip codes. About 40% of purchased prospects identified as White, 39% as Latinx, 8% Black, 5% Asian, and 3% multiracial. In comparison, the population of 15-19 year olds in these 49 five-digit zip codes are 24% White, 43% Hispanic, 20% Black, 3% Asian, and 3% multiracial.

Figure \@ref(fig:texasam-race) presents the average percentage point difference between the racial/ethnic composition of students lists and of the 15-19 year old population across all zip codes filtered by the master's university in this analysis. For example, Zip Code 752 in Figure \@ref(fig:texasam-race) shows a 16 percentage point difference between White prospects purchased living in the zip code and the overall percentage of White 15-19 year olds living in the zip code (40%- 24% = 16 percentage points), suggesting White prospects are overrepresented in purchased lists relative to the population of their home zip code. Similarly, the figure shows a -12 percentage point difference between the Black prospects purchased from the zip code and the percentage of Black 15-19 year olds living in the zip code (8% - 20% = -23 percentage points), suggesting Black prospects are underrepresented in purchased lists relative to the population of their home zip code.

```{r texasam-race, fig.height = 4, fig.cap = 'Texas A&M purchases by zip code and race'}
table_texasam_zip$stu_race_cb <- factor(table_texasam_zip$stu_race_cb, levels = rev(c('AIAN', 'Asian', 'Black', 'Latinx', 'Multiracial', 'White')))

  xlab('Percentage point difference') + ylab('3-digit zip code') +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse = T))
```

Overall, Figure \@ref(fig:texasam-race) suggests prospect lists from orders that filtered using graduation class, PSAT scores, GPA, and zip code tend to be more White and Asian and less Black and Latinx relative to the population of 15-19 year olds from zip codes filtered by. The overepresentation of White prospects in comparison to zip code populations ranged from 2 to 36 percentage points for 11 of the 23 zip codes filtered by, whereas three zip codes had proportional representation (0 percetage point difference). The remaining 9 zip codes had an underrepresentation of White prospects, where eight orders ranged from 1 to 6 percentage points and one order had -21 percentage points. The overrepresentation of Asian prospects purchased across the 23 zip codes ranged from 1 to 17 percentage points.

Black prospects were underrepresented relative to zip code populations across all zip codes used and in the greatest magnitude across all racial/ethnic groups. The underrepresentation of Black prospects purchased across the 23 zip codes ranged from 2 to 47 percentage points. Latinx students were also underrepresented across 12 of the 23 zip codes, although the magnitude was not as large as (ranging from 1 to 10 percentage points). Three of the zip codes filtered by had proportional representation of Latinx students (0 percentage point difference), whereas the remaining zip codes had an overrepresentation ranging from 1 to 4 percentage points. 

Economic disparities are also evident when we compare the average median income of prospects relative to the average median household of the zip code population. Figure \@ref(fig:texasam-income)  presents the difference in average median household income between prospects (measured at the 5-digit zip code level) and the average median household income across all nested 5-digit zip codes within the 3-digit filters used. Because both prospects' and population income is measured at the zip code level across 5- versus 3-digits, a disparity indicates more prospects living in affluent 5-digit zip codes were purchased than the average median household income across all 5-digit codes within the 3-digit filter. 

Figure \@ref(fig:texasam-income) shows student lists resulting from 22 of the 23 zip code filters included more affluent prospects than the average population of those zip codes. This disparity was largest for prospects purchased from 774 zip codes (communities within Richmond, Texas), which had an average median income nearly $40,000 greater than the average median income of the population across all nested 774 zip codes. Prospects purchased from 758 zip codes (communities within Palestine, Texas) were the only across all filters to have an average median income less than the population across all nested zip codes (\$43,000 versus \$50,000).

### Geodemographic Segment Filters

College Board began offering geodemographic search filters with the creation of the Segment Analysis Service (herein Segment). Geodemography -- now often referred to as "spatial big data" -- is a branch of market research that estimates the behavior of consumers based on where they live. According to @RN2039:

> The basic tenet of geodemography is that people with similar cultural backgrounds, means, and perspectives naturally gravitate toward one another or form relatively homogeneous communities; in other words, birds of a feather flock together. When they are living in a community, people\ldots share similar patterns of consumer behavior toward products, services, media, and promotions. The primary appeal of geodemography from the marketer's perspective is that, with just an address, s/he can begin to craft an image about a particular set of individuals based on the values, tastes, expectations, and behaviors associated with their geographic community (p. 1).

This quote illustrates that geodemography is based on problematic assumptions. People with similar cultural backgrounds do not "naturally gravitate toward one another" [@RN2039, p. 1]. Rather, U.S. neighborhoods and schools are racially segregated because of historic and ongoing systematic discrimination embedded in policy and law [@RN4551; @rothstein2017color]. @RN2039 (p. i) describes Segment as "an Educationally Relevant Geodemographic Tagging Service" that enables universities to filter prospects based on the college-going characteristics of the high schools prospects attend or the neighborhoods prospects live in. We argue that student list products that build on existing patterns of segregation are likely to reinforce historical race-based inequality in educational opportunity.

To build Segment, College Board integrates information about test-takers and their neighborhood and school -- including historical college going behavior. These data are grouped by high school and grouped by neighborhood (census-tract). Next, cluster analysis is used to "to group the 33,000+ high schools and 44,000 neighborhoods into 29 unique high-school types and 33 unique neighborhood types" [@RN2039, p. 4], resulting in high school (HS) clusters HS:51-HS:79 and educational neighborhood (EN) clusters EN:51-EN:83. When buying names, a Segment customer may purchase prospects who scored within a particular range on the SAT, and live in a particular set of metropolitan areas, and who are associated with particular combinations of neighborhood and high school cluster (e.g., neighborhood cluster EN:73 and high school categories HS:65 or HS:70). 

Figures \@ref(tab:orders-cluster-en) and \@ref(tab:orders-cluster-hs), recreated from @RN2039, show the characteristics of Segment neighborhood clusters and school clusters, respectively. These clusters are highly correlated with both racial and income demographics. For example, neighborhood cluster EN78 is 26% nonwhite and has median income of \$134,400 while neighborhood cluster EN:71 is 97% nonwhite and has median income of \$42,661.

We analyze 8 orders by a public research university that utilized Segment filters and specified very similar academic criteria across orders. These eight orders were made between XXXX and XXXX, targeted 2019-2023 high school graduating classes, and resulted in 131,562 purchased prospects.  All eight orders filtered on prospect GPAs ranging from a low of B- to a high of A+. The orders specified minimum PSAT/SAT scores ranging from 1220-1240 and maximum PSAT/SAT scores of 1450.^[Five orders specified a minimum of 1240 on the SAT or PSAT and a maximum of 1450 on the SAT or PSAT; One order specified a minimum of 1230 on the SAT or PSAT and a maximum of 1450 on the SAT or PSAT; two orders specified a minimum of 1240 on the SAT or 1220 on the PSAT and a maximum of 1450 on the SAT or PSAT ] Prospects were also geographically filtered across State/CBSAs and segments. Several large CBSAs were consistently targeted across orders (including but not limited to Atlanta, New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Washington D.C., Detroit, Phoenix, Miami, Orlando, Baltimore, Denver, Raleigh).

All eight orders filtered on the same combination of Segment high school and neighborhood clusters, as follows:

- Neighborhood cluster 51, with any high school cluster
- Neighborhood cluster 53, with high school cluster 70
- Neighborhood cluster 58, with any high school cluster 
- Neighborhood cluster 60, with high school clusters 65, 70, or 79
- Neighborhood cluster 61, with high school cluster 65
- Neighborhood cluster 63, with high school clusters 68 or 70
- Neighborhood cluster 69, with high school clusters 65 or 79
- Neighborhood cluster 70, with high school clusters 65, 68, 70, or 75
- Neighborhood cluster 73, with any high school cluster
- Neighborhood cluster 78, with high school cluster 66
- High school cluster 79, with any neighborhood cluster

\@ref(tab:orders-cluster-en) and \@ref(tab:orders-cluster-hs) show that selected neighborhood and high school clusters -- highlighed in blue -- tended to have a higher income and a lower percentage of non-white students than clusters that were not selected, although this was not true across all selected clusters.

Figure X compares racial and income the characteristics of purchased prospects to the characteristics of all high school students. We show four metropolitan areas, where many prospects were purchased: New York (27,932 prospects purchased, rank #1), Los Angeles (12,307 prospects purchased, rank #2), Philadelphia (9,126 prospects purchased, rank #3), Washington, DC (5,728 prospects purchased, rank #4). For each metropolitan area, we show two figures: on the left column, we show the racial composition of purchased prospects living in the metropolitan area compared to the racial composition of all public high school students in the metropolitan area; on the right column, we show the average median income -- defined as XXX -- of purchased prospects living in the metropolitan area compared to the median income of the metropolitan area.

For New York, Figure X shows White and Asian students comprised 56.5% and 26.5% of purchased prospects, respectively, compared to 36.7% and 11.7% of students in public high schools. By contrast, Black and Latinx students comprised jut 1.31% and 8.04% of purchased prospects, respectively, compared to 17.8% and 31.7% of students in public high schools. Furthermore, purchased prospects lived in zip codes that were much more affluent -- an average of XXXX -- than the New York metropolitan area median income of XXXXXX. 

Figure X shows similar patterns for race in other three metropolitan areas. The race results for Philidelphia were particularly egregious, with Black and Latinx students representing 25.3% and 12.4% of public high school students, respectively, but only 1.81% and 4.60% of purchased prospects. Wide income disparities were present across metropolitan areas. In Washington, DC, purchased prospects lived in zip codes with an average median household income of \$148,371 compared to XXXXX for the metropolitan area as a whole.

To what extent are these income disparities driven by the use of geodemographic Segment filters versus the other filters (e.g., SAT/PSAT score ranges) utilized in these orders? Unfortunately, the data we obtained via public records requests cannot address this question. What we can say is that the racial and income patterns observed in these orders are unacceptable. The use of geodemographic Segment filters may have contributed to these patterns. In the future, policymakers and researchers should obtain the data necessary to rigorously investigate the extent to which Segment filters cause racial, socioeconomic, and geographic disparities in purchased prospects.

For example, the top panel shows the resulting student lists for University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign that targeted prospects within the Los Angeles metropolitan area using these filters. The brown bars indicate the students lists for these orders resulted in 18,420 purchased prospects living in the metropolitan area. About 30% of purchased prospects identified as White, 49% as Asian, 1% as Black, 9% as Latinx, and 7% as multiracial. In comparison, the blue bars in the figure indicate the population of public high school students in the Los Angeles metropolitan area are 18% White, 13% Asian, 6% Black, 60% Latinx, and 3% Multiracial.

Across orders using graduation class, segment, SAT or PSAT, and GPA filters within the Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and New York Metropolitan areas, prospect lists resulted in higher percentages of White and Asian students relative to the population of public high school students within each metropolitan area. The overrepresentation of White prospects in student lists relative to the population of public high school students ranged from 12 to 17 percentage points across the three metropolitan areas. Purchased prospects within the Los Angeles metropolitan areas exemplified the largest disparity for Asian students, with 49% of purchased prospects identifying as Asian relative to the 13% of public high school students identifying as Asian within the metropolitan area (a 36 percentage point difference). 

Figure \@ref(fig:metro-race) shows Black and Latinx prospects were underrepresented relative to public school students across all three metropolitan areas. Orders made within the Philadelphia metropolitan area exemplify the largest magnitude in this disparity for Black students, with Black students making up less than 2% of purchased prospects while making up more than 25% of all public high school students in the metropolitan area. The underrepresentation of Black prospects in comparison to public high school students was 16 percentage points for the New York and 3 percentage points for the Los Angeles metropolitan areas. On the other hand, the Los Angeles metropolitan area exemplified the largest disparity for Latinx students (9% Latinx purchased prospects versus 60% Latinx public high school students).  The underrepresentation of Latinx prospects in comparison to public high school students was 8 percentage points for the Philadelphia and 24 percentage points for the New York metropolitan areas.

Figure \@ref(fig:metro-income) presents the average median household income of purchased prospects (taken at the 5-digit zip code level) in comparison to the median household income of the entire metropolitan area. For example, the median income across all households in the Philadelphia metropolitan area is \$75,000, whereas prospects living within the metropolitan area purchased by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign had an average median household income of \$114,000. Prospects purchased tended to have higher median average household incomes than the average across all households within the Los Angeles and New York metropolitan areas also. The difference was nearly \$50,000 for New York and \$30,000 for Los Angeles.

### Women in STEM

Two of the research universities in the study made orders targeting prospective students who are women interested in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). These orders targeted women interested in STEM primarily through two different filter patterns. The first pattern used SAT scores (ranging from 1300 to 1600), GPA (ranging from a low of B and high of A+), a state filter (in-state versus out-of-state), and students' self-reported intended major. The second pattern also used the same SAT, GPA, and state filters, but STEM interest was proxied via AP test scores. For in-state prospective students, orders filtered for prospects scoring from 3 to 5 on AP STEM tests. For out-of-state prospective students, orders filtered for prospects scoring 4 or 5 on AP STEM tests. ^[The second university also targeted women interested in engineering majors through the use of segment filters at the high school and neighborhood levels in combination with some achievement filter (e.g., PSAT, SAT, GPA).] 

In order to analyze in-depth patterns in the racial and economic characteristics of prospects that result from the combination of achievement, geographic, and gender filters used to target women interested in STEM, we analyze prospect profiles purchased in Texas. The University of California, San Diego made a total of 11 orders targeting women in STEM, which resulted in 12,938 prospect profiles purchased. Of the 10,668 total out-of-state prospective student profiles purchased by the university, 1,134 of these prospects are from Texas. We selected to "zoom" into Texas to take advantage of data provided by the Texas Education Agency on AP test takers as a comparison group for purchased prospects. Thus, we focus analyses on the 559 of the 1,134 Texas prospects whose profiles were purchased via AP filters. However, given the well-document racial and economic disparities in access to AP coursework, we first compare prospects to the population of 15-19 year olds in their home zip codes and in zip codes where zero prospective students' profiles were purchased. Broad patterns in the comparisons of prospects to the population of 15-19 year olds across zip codes were similar for the other two top ranked states with the most prospect profiles purchased via AP filters (e.g., New York, Florida) [DOUBLE CHECK THIS KS-- TRUE FOR Metro areas but need to check entire states].

[KS: just realized comparison group race/ethnicity are not just women; includes all gender; need to pull ACS data with race/ethnicity BY gender; but I don't think general patterns will change significaly by include only women]

Our analysis first focuses on comparing the racial characteristics of Texas prospects whose profiles were purchased to the population of 15-19 year olds in their home zip codes. The university purchased at least one prospective students' profile from 203 of the 1,935 zip codes in Texas. Figure X presents the racial characteristics of prospects to the population of 15-19 year olds in these 203 zip codes. The figure shows two general trends consistent across orders targeting Women in STEM. First, White and Asian prospects are overrepresented relative to the population of 15-19 year olds in their home zip codes. For example, nearly 40% of all purchased prospects are White while 38% of the 15-19 year olds in their home zip codes are also White. This difference is much larger for Asian prospects, who make up nearly 30% of all purchased prospect profiles but only make up about 6% of the population of 15-19 year olds in their home zip codes. Second, Black and Latinx prospects are underrepresented to their zip code populations. Black and Latinx prospects make up 2% and 20% of all purchased prospects, respectively, while their home zip code's population of 15-19 year olds are on average 10% Black and 36% Latinx. It's important to note that only 3 of the 559 prospects purchased across Texas were Native American. While looking at proportions across the population of 15-19 year olds in zip codes invisibilizes the number of Native American students in relation to other racial/ethnic groups, the 3 prospects are relative to a total of 3,623 Native American 15-19 year olds living in these 203 zip codes.

As a proxy for comparing prospects to prospective students in Texas whose profiles were not purchased by the university, we also compare the racial and economic characteristics of prospects to the population of 15-19 year olds in the 1,732 non purchased zips in Figure X. Comparing prospects to the average population of zip codes where zero prospective students' profiles were purchased, Asian prospects are again overrepresentated while White prospects shift to being slightly underrepresented. For example, on average, less than 2% of 15-19 year olds in non-purchased zips are Asian but nearly 30% of prospects are Asian. The population of Black and Latinx 15-19 year olds are relatively the same in non-purchased zips to prospects' home zip codes, which result in similar disparities between prospects and non-purchased zip code populations to comparisons with their home-zip codes above.  

Figure X also shows the economic characteristics of prospects and prospective students in Texas whose profiles were not purchased by comparing the average median household income of prospects' home zip codes to the the average median household in the 1,732 non purchased zip codes. Prospects whose profiles were purchased by the university tended to be much more affluent than non-purchased prospetive students. For example, purchased prospects live in Texas zip codes where the average median household income is \$84,722. In comparison, populations living in the 1,732 non purchased zips have an average median income of \$56862. 

Lastly, we use AP participation data from the Texas Education Agency to compare the racial characteristics of prospects whose profiles were purchased by the university to the population of AP science test takers in Texas. ^[These figures also include students who took the International Baccalaureate science exam] The racial and economic inequities in access to AP coursework and disparities in passing rates are well-documented (CITE). However, we compare prospects to test takers to illustrate how using AP score range filters, rather than just proxying STEM interest by students with have the ability to and take AP science coursework, further exacerbates inequities in whose profiles are purchased. 

Figure X compares the racial characteristics of prospects to AP science test takers in Texas. Even though AP test takers is likely to inequitably underpredict the number of women interested in STEM due disparities in access to advanced coursework, we still see large disparities between prospects and test takers. For example, Black students make up 6% of AP science test takers but only 2% of purchased prospects. Similarly, Latinx students make up 40% of test takers but only 15% of AP test takers.
