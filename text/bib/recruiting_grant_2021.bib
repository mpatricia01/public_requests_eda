	Abstract = {In an era of skyrocketing tuition and mounting concern over whether college is "worth it," the authors assess the state of American higher education. They provide a powerful expos{\'e}of unmet obligations and misplaced priorities, and explain in vivid detail why so many leave college with so little to show for it. Mapping different pathways available to students at a flagship Midwestern public university, the authors demonstrate that the most well-resourced and seductive route is a "party pathway" anchored in the Greek system, facilitated by the administration--and with serious disadvantages for the majority of students.},
